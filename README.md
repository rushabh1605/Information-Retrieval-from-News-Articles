# ðŸ“° Information Retrieval from News Articles

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for processing, analyzing, and retrieving information from a corpus of news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores how to extract meaningful insights and structure unstructured text data from news articles. It involves:
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Topic modeling
- BERT-based contextual analysis

The goal is to build a foundational framework for information retrieval tasks that can scale for use in journalism, finance, or intelligence gathering.
